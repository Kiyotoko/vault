The pros of a lingua franca are, that people around the world can communacate with each other and learn new cultures with it. Because of the new ways of communication, a lingua fraca has become more important, for reading sientific papers that was published around the world, for example.
cons: when you understand everyone, you can also understand Max, sometimes you don't want to understand Max, it can also

The reasons for a Lingua Franca are, that the pop culture of the language spreads and more persons what to understand it. Another reason is colonization and wars. With the rise and fall of a nation, also the number of speakers increases.

In the article „Should we bother to learn another language?“ from Ian Wylie, which was published on November 2005 in „The Guardian“, the author discusses if it is worthy to learn another language then English or not.

According to the author, nearly 1 billion people can now speak English. Even if now 5 billion don't speak English, many governments taking actions to raise the number of English speakers in schools and universities. English is the dominating language in the network. English is one of the most popular languages, and without it, a communication between 200 countries would be awfully messy.

But on the other hand, because of English, every two weeks a language dies. English makes the landscape of speech more monolingualism. Most of the people still rather by products if they are in there mother tongue then in English.

Another point is, that we only learn traditional languages like French or German (l. 35 f.) rather then one of the most popular languages Chinese, Hindi or Urdu. 

In conclusion, the author compares English with Latin; If the people speaking it don't start learning another language, the language will end up dying.

Traveling around the world - that is the dream of many. Discovering new places, collecting new experience. Sounds nice, doesn't it? But is it really a good idea to travel the world as often as possible? I think not. 

Learning the culture of other countries can be a great experience, if you can pay for it. But traveling is expensive. You must always at least pay for your living expenses. And this can be seen over a long time be quit hard, because it isn't easy to get a job in a completely different country.
Your healthy matters. In Germany you have a top health support available and health insurance, but when you travel to another country,  the health care system is not always as developed or cheap as in Germany. For example, if you get food poisoned and are in Germany, you can easily get health support, which is paid by your health insurance. But if you are in the USA, you mast self pay for the health care .

Everyone should travel and come around in the world. But traveling to often brings problems that you should be aware of, like paying for your living costs.

Should native English speakers learn another language?

Nearly 1 billion people can now speak English. Even if now 5 billion don't speak English, many governments taking actions to raise the number of English speakers in schools and universities. English is the dominating language in the network. English is one of the most popular languages, and without it, a communication between 200 countries would be awfully messy. If everyone could speak English, communication would be much easier.

English is the most important language in the internet. If you already speak the most important language, why should you waste time on learning something less useful?

In the end, I think that it would be easier if everyone would speak only English.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, 

heute versammeln wir uns hier, in Stuttgart, im Zentrum Europas. Europa, eine Festung des Handels. Eine Festung des Fortschritts. Eine Festung der Freiheit. 

Doch die Fundamente dieser doch so unerschütterlichen Festung sind bedroht; bedroht von Habgier, Lobbyismus und Korruption. 

Allerdings ist dieses Problem weitaus komplexer. Hierbei kann man das Problem nicht nur an einer Person oder Partei festmachen, sondern es handelt sich um ein strukturelles Problem. Ein Problem Namens Lobbyismus. Also, was macht Lobbyismus so gefährlich für die EU, und wie können wir dieses Problem beheben? 

Demokratie sollte stets das Wohl aller fördern, statt den Einzelnen zu bereichern. Doch Lobbyismus hat einen so starken Einfluss auf die Entscheidungen, wodurch das Allgemeinwohl nicht mehr Gewehrleistet werden kann. So wurde auch Artikel 13 durchgesetzt, der das Urheberrecht zu Gunsten weniger Firmen neu regelte. 
Ein weiteres Problem, was unsere Demokratie bedroht, ist die mangelnde Transparenz der Europa Abgeordneten. Hier gibt weitgehend kaum Regulierungen, die es schwer machen, zu verfolgen, wo welche Gesetze wie beeinflusst werden. Das dieses Problem nicht an Relevanz verliert, zeigen ständig neue Skandale über Lobby-Gruppen. 
Auch sollte man bedenken, dass verschiedene Lobby-Gruppen auch verschiedene Interessen vertreten. Doch verschiedene Interessen führen auch immer zu Konflikten. Und genau diese Konflikte führen am Ende zu Gesetzen, die niemanden helfen und nur der Allgemeinheit schaden. 
Hinzu kommt, dass Lobbyisten vor niemanden Rechenschaft für ihren Einfluss auf die EU ablegen müssen. Dieser Mangel ist hoch bedenklich. Besonders ein Vorfall hat uns allen gezeigt, wie gefährlich das sein kann.  2019 wurde eine Lobbyfirma dabei erwischt, wie sie gefälschte Bürgerinitiativen ins Leben rief, um Einfluss auf die EU-Politik zu nehmen. Dies verdeutlicht uns allen den Mangel an Rechenschaftspflicht im Lobbysystem der EU deutlich.
Zuletzt sollte in einer Demokratie jeder gleichermaßen abgebildet werden. Doch Lobby Systeme großer Konzerne machen es kleinen Gruppen schwer, ihre Stimmen in der Politik noch hören zu können. Die Agrarpolitik der EU ist ein Grab des Versagens in dieser Hinsicht, da dort in der Vergangenheit nur große Firmen an der Gesetzgebung beteiligt waren, und der lokale Farmer einfach im Stich gelassen wurde. 
Und wann immer Sie sich denken; “Wo ist das mein Problem?”, sollten sie sich in Erinnerung rufen, dass es auch ihre Stimme ist, genau ihre, die in der Politik so wie viele andere einfach überhört wird. 

Probleme hat jeder. Doch wie lösen wir sie? Hier kommt das Lobbyregister ins Spiel. Mit dem Lobbyregister kann man einfach öffentlich einsehen, welcher Lobbyist welche Gesetze beeinflusst. Leider ist ein Eintrag zurzeit hier in keiner Hinsicht verpflichtend; stattdessen sind die Daten häufig unvollständig oder manchmal schlichtweg falsch. 

Doch Sie können etwas daran ändern! Gehen Sie auf ihren Abgeordneten zu, unterschreiben Sie Petitionen und helfen Sie freiwilligen und unabhängigen Organisationen, wie „lobbypedia“ oder „ abgeordnetenwatch“ .

Danke.

- Barack Obama
- In Chicago at the November 2012
- He speaks to his supporters

- his vision of the American people and the nations future

Examine how President Obama sends a message of shared values to his supporters after being declared the winner in the election. Consider his line of the argument and use of rhetorical devices.
[Obama Speech](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/barack-obama-speech-full-text)

„President Obama's victory speech in Chicago after the 2012 election was a masterclass in rhetorical devices and messaging. In his speech, he aimed to connect with his supporters by emphasizing shared values, while also extending an olive branch to those who had not supported him.

One of the most prominent rhetorical devices used in Obama's speech was anaphora, the repetition of a phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. He used this device to great effect in the opening of his speech, saying "We want out kids to grow up (...). We want our children to live (...). We want to pass on a country (...)" By repeating "We want" three times, Obama emphasized that his message was for everyone, not just his supporters.

Another rhetorical device that Obama used was parallelism. For example, he said, "That's the future we hope for. That's the vision we share. That's where we need to go forward. That's where we need to go." By using parallelism, Obama showed that his message of unity applied to everyone.

Throughout his speech, Obama emphasized the importance of shared values, such as hard work, responsibility, and sacrifice. He said, "[...] with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward [...]" By emphasizing that the change he sought could only happen with the help of his supporters, Obama showed that they shared a commitment to creating a better future for everyone.

Overall, Obama's victory speech was a masterful display of rhetorical devices and messaging. By emphasizing shared values and reaching out to those who had not supported him, he was able to unite the country and inspire hope for a better future.“

A dream deferred refers to the American Dream, which will remain unfulfilled for many. This is due to the uneven distribution of wealth, which has led to many living in poverty and having little chance of social advancement

Parents with a good income conceive this to their children and they will also have a good income and a good future. If the parents have a good stand, the children will also feel the same way. If they don't have it, the children won't have it either.
