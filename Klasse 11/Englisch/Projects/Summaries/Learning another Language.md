In the article „Should we bother to learn another language?“ from Ian Wylie, which was published on November 2005 in „The Guardian“, the author discusses if it is worthy to learn another language then English or not.

According to the author, nearly 1 billion people can now speak English. Even if now 5 billion don't speak English, many governments taking actions to raise the number of English speakers in schools and universities. English is the dominating language in the network. English is one of the most popular languages, and without it, a communication between 200 countries would be awfully messy.

But on the other hand, because of English, every two weeks a language dies. English makes the landscape of speech more monolingualism. Most of the people still rather by products if they are in there mother tongue then in English.

Another point is, that we only learn traditional languages like French or German (l. 35 f.) rather then one of the most popular languages Chinese, Hindi or Urdu. 

In conclusion, the author compares English with Latin; If the people speaking it don't start learning another language, the language will end up dying.
