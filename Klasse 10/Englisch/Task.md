Speed_Limit - an important step or an unnecessary restriction?

It is one of the most discussed topics in germany - speed limit! But what are the advantages and disadvantages?

First of all, a speed limit would contain a lot of work. The police has to control each car, which ensures that they are kept from more important tasks.
On the other side, a speed limit would reduce the noise level. Today, many persons are stressed because of a to hight noise level. Thus, a speed limit would solve or at least reduce the problem.
Many say, that a speed limit would be a requierment for a saver traffic. But this is not completly true! When you are looking on other countries with a speed limit, like France for example, they have more traffic ancidents then germany without a speed limit.
On top of that, the speed limit would be a restriction of personal freedom. Each person has a free choice ... including the choice how fast or slow they want to drive!
But in case of the clima change, many persons are searching for a way how they can reduce there emissions. Driving slowlier is a good and easy way how each person can stop the clima change. And here is the point: with a speed limit, together we would reduce 2.6 mil tons CO².

After all, I would disagree with a speed limit, because of a to long list of disatvantages and problems. But I would advise everyone to voluntarily slow down there speed to protect themselves, others and the environment.

Everyone knows it, you drive quite comfortably with 180 km/h over the freeway, think about the further course of the day and then realize, speed limit: 100 km/h. But why do we have a speed limit, isn't this actually unnecessary?

A good argument in favour of a speed limit is the issue of noise protection. Never before have so many cars been traveling so fast on German highways. The resulting noise can be a great burden on both people and nature. A high noise level can provoke stress in the long term, which is a trigger for cardiovascular complaints, for example. A speed limit could significantly reduce the noise level. On the other hand, it has to be said that a speed limit would not guarantee more safety. Statistics show that significantly fewer people are killed in accidents on highways than on country roads. Countries with speed limits, such as France, do not have a better safety record than Germany, according to the ADAC. Moreover, studies in countries with speed limits show that a speed limit does not encourage drivers to buy small motorized vehicles. It must be said, however, that a speed limit would significantly reduce emissions of pollutants and would thus be an important contribution to climate protection. A study conducted by the Federal Environment Agency in 2020 shows that a speed limit of a maximum of 130 km/h would lead to a reduction of 1.9 million tons in carbon dioxide emissions, while a restriction to 120 km/h could even save 2.6 million tons of CO₂ per year. In the long term, this will look quite different again. A speed limit would not mean a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions.  The ADAC has calculated a maximum savings potential of three percent. These figures relate to passenger car traffic in Germany. According to the ADAC, a general speed limit on highways could reduce Germany's total CO₂ emissions by just 0.5 percent. An increase in road safety is also frequently cited as an argument. A general speed limit could possibly reduce the number of serious accidents. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, in 2018, on stretches of road without a speed limit, increased speed was a cause of 45 percent of traffic fatalities - 135 out of 301 accident fatalities - in addition to a lack of distance, for example. If you look at this from a different perspective, the problems become more frequent. A speed limit would not guarantee more safety. Statistics show that far fewer people are killed in accidents on highways than on country roads. Countries with speed limits, such as France, do not have a better safety record than Germany, according to ADAC. In addition, a very low speed limit could lead to drivers feeling underchallenged. As a result, they might drive less concentrated, which in turn could increase the risk of accidents.

As a result, I would argue that a speed limit doesn't really make sense.

*Fair Wear Foundations*

Fair Wear Foundation (Fair Wear) is an independent multi-stakeholder organisation that works with garment brands, garment workers and industry influencers to improve labour conditions in garment factories. Receiving the Fair Wear stamp of approval does not guarantee any existing quality of labour standards, instead only demonstrating a stated interest in working toward improvement. 

The Fair Wear Code of Labour Practices contains eight labour standards that are based on the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.[4] The Fair Wear Code of Labour Practices is known for its strong provisions on freedom of association, hours of work, and a living wage. It is important to note, however, that none of these practices are mandated for claiming association with Fair Wear.

Fair Wear's eight labour standards are:

    Employment is freely chosen
    There is no discrimination in employment
    No exploitation of child labour
    Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
    Payment of a living wage
    No excessive working hours
    Safe and healthy working conditions
    Legally binding employment relationship

*FSC*

The Forest Stewardship Council is an international non-profit organization. The Bonn-based company was founded in 1993.
It is an international certification system for more sustainable forest management. The wood from furniture, toys, books, exercise books or pencils with the FSC seal comes from forests that are managed more responsibly.
The aim of the FSC is to promote ecologically appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable forest management. On the other hand, the FSC wants to ensure that today's needs are met without endangering the needs of future generations.

Fairtrade - far More than a Cetification Scheme!

It is one of the largest and most diverse global movements for change: Fairtrade. Everyone knows it's famous icon. It stands for a product, that is qually owned and managed *by* producers *for* producers. But do you also know all its criteria and producer system? When not, then you are here right!

First of all, Fairtrade works with more than 1.8 million farmers and workers, and supports over 2000 fair trade towns in 28 countries, plus a bunch of schools, universities and faith groups.
Fairtrade provides more savety for the workers. In reallity, this means for the farmers to receive over 994 € million in premium money.
A farmer must meet social, environmental and eonomic criteria. That includes requierments on demographic sel-organisation, responsible water and waste management and the Fairtrade Minimum Price.
Fairtrade has one of the best criteria systems on the market, so if you are serious about sustainability, you should by fairtrade!

Hopefully, you have learned a lot! Do you know also other certification systems? Then leave a comment! See you next time!
