Hello my friend,

Integration, especially in the field of sports, is very important in Germany for cultural cohesion and integration. Here, too, soccer produces many role models who prove that success in Germany has nothing to do with ancestry.

Sports clubs in particular help to integrate refugees. Participating in sports competitions together strengthens social cohesion and eliminates mutual prejudices.

Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Just a few decades ago, guest workers in Germany were treated badly and exploited. So it is all the more wonderful to be able to talk about participation and equal opportunities today!

With kind regards
Karl Zschiebsch
