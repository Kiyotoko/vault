1. How would a handful of modified human affect the gene pool of entire future generations?
	- Could alternate the complete gene pool because their genes will be passed down to their children.
2. What would genetic engineering be used for at the beginning? How would that evolve?
	- Primary for health
	- Can evolve to give any change like looking's or intelligence
3. What could be a negative outcome of increased genetic engineering?
	- The temptation for huge upgrades will be great.
	- Rejecting not perfect humans
4. Which reality do we already face when it comes to selecting humans?
	- Preselecting humans on medical conditions

1. State in which fields genetic engineering ins commonly used.
	1. Widely used in agriculture
	2. In medicine
2. State what CRISPR stands for.
	1. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
3. Take notes on how CRISPR-Cas works
	1. RNA matches DNA
	2. Cas proteins cut DNA
	3. gRNA is combined with the Cas protein, acts like a guide
	5. Cut triggers repair mechanism
4. Explain the term "cloning".
	1. Cloning is the complete copying of the DNA of an organism to create a new one.
5. Take notes on how cloning works.
	1. Take a single cell
	2. Remove the nucleus into a egg cell.
	3. Transfer the nucleus from the taken cell into a the egg cell.

Hey Emily,

it is nice to hear from you! Of course I want to help you. I have red an article from the online magazine "sueddeutsche" about GMOs in the EU.

- The EU favours GMOs
- A new bill is currently discussed
- Green Gentechnology shall be the new standard in the food supply chain
- The genom modifies plants targeted
- The EU wants an agreement between crossing two new plants and programming new gen sequences
- Changes of NGTs (New Genetic Tecnologies) can not longer be identified with common analysing methods
- Modified plants with up to 20 modifications should be seen equal to conventianel plants
- NGT-Plants or Products can not longer be prohibited or limited
- Could mark the end of organic products

I hope these information have helped you!

Kind regards
Karl Zschiebsch
