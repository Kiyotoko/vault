⚙ Hello there! ⚙

This is my Obsidian Vault (in German) for school and LSGM maths camps, which I upload here as a backup and for sharing. Some files, especially those that have a lot of equations, internal images or similar, are probably not rendered properly by Github by default. If this is the case, please download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the following plugins:
- Admonition
- Obsidian Functionplot

All folders are sorted by class and subject.
